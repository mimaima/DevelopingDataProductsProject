In Texas, electricity prices in whole sale market are different for each hour each day.
User can view the 24 hours' electricity prices by choosing the day of week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.), then the curve will be updated.

The median hourly electricity prices are based on the most recent 30 days data downloaded from ERCOT.com.

The electricity price data are downloaded from http://www.ercot.com.(webpage: Market Information -> Market Prices -> DAM Settlement Point Prices.)

* Note: I had submitted both a shiny app URL and a link of my github repository with the ui.R and server.R files on Monday(6/23), and I had seen the two links working on Monday(6/23). This Thursday morning(6/26), I noticed that my app's URL brings to an error message ("Page not found"). It belonged to the external server's problem. Redeploy resolved it. To evaluate the project, another way is that cloning  github repository on local machine.then runApp().
